<p>I recently moved to Bangalore, it&rsquo;s called the IT/Technical Hub of India. Well, I moved here for my Internship at FOSS United. Thanks a lot to my managers they invited me to come and work from office. And for me this is kind of a very difference.</p>
<p>Before this I have never lived alone for more than 7 days, this is the first ever time when I&rsquo;ll be leaving alone, 650 km away from my parents in a very new and busy city. I haven&rsquo;t actually fell in love with this city, well that&rsquo;s obvious because I haven&rsquo;t I haven&rsquo;t explored it much, I have only seen the negatives till now. I hope someone helps me explore Bengaluru.</p>
<p>There have been moments, when I totally feel hatred and wanted to go back, but on the contrary there are moments when I&rsquo;m enjoying with my colleagues, having fun learning different things. Whenever I take a moment away from the computer, I am blank and I have very weird questions in my mind.</p>
<p>But nvm Everything happens for good!</p>
