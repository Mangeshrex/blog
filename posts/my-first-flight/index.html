<h3 id="indiafoss-30">IndiaFOSS 3.0</h3>
<p>IndiaFOSS 3.0 was around the corner and we all were preparing for the conference working hard day and night without sleep. That day all of a sudden from nowhere my friends told me that my class test was announced for 26-27-28 October and IndiaFOSS 3.0 was happening on 28th October. I was totally terrified and had no idea of what I was gonna do. All of a sudden one of my colleagues said &ldquo;Maybe we can do a flight for you&rdquo; and <a href="https://wisharya.com">Vishal Arya</a> booked a flight for me. But, the flight was from Pune because I&rsquo;m a native of Solapur and the Solapur Airport is not functional due to some political reasons I feel.</p>
<p>It was all pretty sorted, all I had to do was go home on the 26th morning to do the exams but with a little twist. we usually have 2 exams on one day, and on the 27th and 28th the exams were online. I was gonna leave on the 27th after the first written exam and the second exam at 1 was the online one. But, my college has a weird policy that every student should take the online exam from the classroom itself (yeah, totally nonsense but kuchh na kahe ?) and I did not take permission to do that. After the first exam, I just left the college and took a train from Solapur at 2:00 PM. The whole plan was to reach Pune by 6 PM (according to the train schedule) and board the flight at 9:20 PM.</p>
<h3 id="fun-begins">Fun begins</h3>
<p>Of course, It did not go as planned. the train got delayed by 1.5 hours and I was totally terrified, all I wanted was to attend the conference which I had worked day and night for and also have fun with all the other people at the conference. It was just something that I never wanted to miss.</p>
<p>The train reached Pune railway station at 7:30 PM and what I had to do was just run because the boarding gate was to be closed at 8:25 and I was pretty far from the airport in the traffic, so all I was worried about was not missing the flight. It was the first time I was going to sit on a plane and also my dad had booked a plane ticket for the first time to come to the conference. we reached Pune station by 8:35 and rushed towards the boarding gate, they were just going to close and I finally managed to stop them and get inside.</p>
<p>We got into the aircraft and I was like &ldquo;Andar se itna chhota hota hai&rdquo; lmao, but yeah made sense because it wasn&rsquo;t as big as others, but it still had that feeling. We got to our seats, I had booked a window seat for my dad and he was like a small kid who adores everything lol.</p>
<p>It was a Boeing 737 Aircraft if I remember correctly. I was always somehow interested in aircraft but never really went into the technical depths other than just surface level. I remember watching this good documentary called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watchv=yt3flDeOI6w&amp;t=4171s&amp;pp=ygUgVGhlIGJvZWluZyBzY2FuZGFsICB5b2dlc2ggYmFiYXI%3D">&ldquo;The Boeing Scandal&rdquo;</a>, was a pretty good one but not very much in-depth explaining everything about what happened in the scandal related to Boeing 737 MAX.</p>
<p>The take-off was very pretty scary and my heart started beating faster during the speed run on the runway, but it was fun. And like every other first-timer, I did have a headache and murmuring feeling. After landing, I was just amazed looking at that big ass Airport.</p>
<p>Great experience tho, all thanks to FOSS United xD.</p>
