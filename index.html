    <h2>Hi, I'm Mangesh</h2>
    <p>I am an 18 (very soon) student and Free Software Enthusiast from India. I believe a lot in the hacker and tinkerer culture and have been trying to be wonk about learning different things.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I might say, I'm not a very good/great coder but I'm trying to get more and more involved into coding. But, I running behind something won't help you reach it, so I just keep exploring.
    <br/>
    Currently, I'm based in bangalore because of my internship at <b><a href="https://fossunited.org/about">FOSS United</a></b> and I volunteer for them around a couple of things. I am a third year diploma student, and I hate academics which is why I took leave from college and shifted to bangalore because why not ?
    <br />
    Me, my life and everything around me just happens randomly.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was never a geek / technology guy from my childhood like most are. I was a hardcore and full time music player. I play tabla, used to play flute for a couple of years. I randomly got in tech due to some
random instagram posts about linux. And, then my dad got me a old dell laptop (without battery fixed) and got linux installed on it on <b>13 Oct, 2020</b>. And since, then I have been a full time linux user.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am a huge photography freak too, I like taking pictures of villagers, kids and basically anything which shows a different kind of emotion. I also do like b/w photography. For me every photograph is something which tries to speak and b/w photographs are very silent. But, from the recent times I have stopped taking pictures and I might get back into it soon.
