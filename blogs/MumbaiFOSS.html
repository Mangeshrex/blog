                MumbaiFOSS and my experience there</h2>
            <p>I’m doing my <strong>2nd-year diploma</strong> in <strong>computer
                    engineering</strong>. I have always been a huge fan of
                <strong>FOSS</strong> such as GNU/Linux, it was the reason I chose
                computer engineering but unfortunately, there was nothing in-depth on it
                in my course curriculum. I had seen people share posters of a FOSS event
                called IndiaFOSS on LinkedIn. I just looked up about it on the internet,
                it was conducted by FOSS United, a foundation that aims at promoting and
                strengthening the FOSS ecosystem in India. It was held in Bengaluru, far
                away from where I lived and my parents wouldn’t let me travel alone if I
                asked.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite the disheartening turn of events, I never gave up on my
                desire to attend a FOSS event. The next year, when a similar FOSS event
                called MumbaiFOSS was conducted by FOSS United in IIT Bombay. I decided
                that it was finally time for me to go. I asked my parents if they would
                allow me, and they agreed.</p>
            <p>So, armed with some cash and fervor, I set off from Solapur to attend
                MumbaiFOSS on a local train for a journey of almost 500 km to reach the
                venue. I couldn’t sleep that night because of the excitement and the
                snoring of the sleeping passengers nearby. I reached <strong>Thane Station</strong> in
                the early morning and got off the train. I took another local train from
                Thane to Kanjurmarg station. I reached <strong>Kanjurmarg Station</strong>, I fell while
                getting off the train and I had a minor wound but I was more worried
                about whether my laptop was damaged. After checking laptop was safe, I
                took a rickshaw from there to Gate 2 of IIT Bombay. Being from a small
                city, I was excited to see an IIT campus for the first time, that too
                one of the best IITs in India. The campus was very beautiful, neat, and
                clean.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once there, I ate a non-affordable breakfast outside the campus and
                then caught up with my telegram friend <strong><span class="citation"
                        data-cites="MisanthropyDK">@MisanthropyDK</span></strong> (we met for
                the first time), and saw many peeps in the tech industry. I had a
                conversation with a white-haired man who was a <strong>Fedora
                    fanboi</strong> and had years of experience in the FOSS industry, he was
                like an <strong>Indian version of Richard Stallman</strong>. From that
                conversation, it felt like age did not matter nor did the skillset each
                one of us carried with us, everything felt equal when we interacted. One
                thing I remember he said was, “All technologies are inter-related, some
                people are narrow minded they study only one technology and try to
                master it, that’s the reason why they cannot inter-relate with other
                technologies.”. I felt very motivated to keep up my hunger for learning
                many and not ust one.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The first talk about the <strong>Prav app</strong>. The speakers gave
                a fantastic explanation of why <strong>XMPP</strong>,
                <strong>Matrix</strong>, and other open-source chat platforms are better
                to use. And they were able to convince the sense of privacy and control
                of these platforms. I was convinced that I should switch to Matrix.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The electronic field-related project which included eSIM made by
                <strong>Mr. Sumanto Kar</strong> and <strong>Mr. Nagesh Karmali</strong>
                was very cool. After a tea break, it was the talk on WebRTC (Web
                Real-Time Communication). And this was the time when I came to know
                about servers like <strong>STUN</strong> and <strong>TURN</strong> that
                are used to create P2P connections when building a real-time
                application. And a lot more about the protocols used in WebRTC.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>And then walks in <strong>Mr. Ashish Sahni</strong> who blew my mind.
                His topic was one of the hardest ones for me to digest, I mean it was a
                way too advanced topic than others. It was all about the data
                architecture and how powerful data fabrication. Honestly speaking, I
                don’t have much to tell about this. So I’ll back off from this.</p>
            <p>The next talk was by <strong>Mr. Poruri Sai Rahul</strong>, an
                energetic and talented guy. His talk was about <strong>Digital Personal
                    Data Protection Bills (DPDPB)</strong>. This was again a new topic for
                me. And this talk was the one I enjoyed the most. In short, the bill was
                about the protection of your data collected from whatever online
                platform you use. It may be a search engine or any other app. He started
                with a game called <strong>“Cost and Benefits”</strong>. What we had to
                do was just point out when the Cost and Benefits were high in a
                particular paragraph from the Data Bill. In my opinion, this was the
                only talk that was very interactive of all.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Then comes the fireside chat with Mr. Kailash Nadh. Those moments
                made me realize what life can be like beyond college lectures, it opened
                up a range of opportunities that didn’t seem possible before thanks to
                networking opportunities provided by events such as this one.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-3xl">Rant Alert</h3>
                <img class="h-auto p-2" src="../asset/firesidechat.png">
                <p>The <strong>fireside chat</strong> with <strong>Kailash Nadh</strong> was an eye-opening experience
                    that made me understand that we are just a bunch of scum in college who
                    yet don’t know anything more advanced. It’s just 0.0000001℅ of the
                    basics we engineering students know. We should be knowing and doing
                    stuff that is far more advanced than the current scenario. I won’t blame
                    anyone and I don’t even know whom should I blame. There are very less
                    students in an engineering institute who care about tech and are
                    fascinated by the processes. Everyone mostly runs behind being a topper,
                    getting a good college ahead for being a grad. There are a lot of things
                    that are unknown in this internet world that we yet need to explore and
                    keep advancing with them.</p>
                <p>This experience gave me a whole new perspective on life &amp;
                    technology. If anyone thinks attending such events is expensive, it was
                    only INR 1600/- for train tickets, food, and registration.</p>
