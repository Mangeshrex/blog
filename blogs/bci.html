      <br>
      <p class="text-lg ">A <strong>brain chip</strong> is a very tiny computer chip that is
        similar to a size of a coin. Our brain pretty much works similarly to a
        computer i/o process. There are 86 Billion neurons in your brain.</p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl px2 py-2" id="bio-mehhhh">Bio-MEHHHH</h2>
    <p class="text-lg ">Neurons are responsible for sending or receiving information. A
      neuron is divided into three sub-parts: A dendrite responsible for
      receiving a signal, a cell body that processes the signal, and an axon
      that sends a signal out. You might feel that this is very relatable with
      a computer I/O process. This chip is implanted into the human skull
      using <strong>neural implants</strong>. This chip connects to thousands
      of neurons in the brain and stimulates them. These chips are capable of
      converting the natural axon single into ones readable by the chip. It
      also includes an external non-invasive technique such as EEG. EEG
      (electroencephalogram) is a test that measures electrical activity in
      the brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) that are attached to the
      scalp. brain chips work on the principle of BCI (Brain Computer
      Interfacing).</p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="text-4xl px2 py-2" id="brain-computer-interfacing">Brain Computer Interfacing</h1>
    <p class="text-lg ">Brain-computer interfacing is originating in work from the 1960s by
      Delgado and Fetz. Delgado developed an implantable chip (which he called
      a “stimoceiver”) that could be used to both stimulate the brain by radio
      and send electrical signals of brain activity by telemetry. The most
      significant feature of BCI are 1. <strong>Brain recording</strong>:
      Signals from the brain are recorded using either invasive or
      non-invasive recording techniques. 
      <br>
      2. <strong>Signal
        Processing</strong>: Raw signals are pre-processed after acquisition and
      techniques for artifact reduction.
      <br> 3. <strong>Brain
        stimulation</strong>: The stimulation pattern received from the signal
      processing component is used in conjunction with invasive or
      non-invasive stimulation techniques.</p>
      <br>
    <h2 class="text-4xl px2 py-2" id="types-of-bci ">Types of BCI</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><strong>Invasive BCIs</strong>: These involve recording from or
        stimulating neurons inside the brain.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Invasive BCIs</strong>: These employ techniques for
          recording from or stimulating the brain without penetrating the skin or
        skull.</li>
      <br>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-lg "><em>With both of these types, we can have BCIs which Only record from
        the brain (and translate neural data into control signals for output
        devices.) or Only stimulate the brain (and cause certain desired
        patterns for neural activity).</em></p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-4xl px2 py-2" id="elaborating-bci">Elaborating BCI</h2>
    <p class="text-lg ">The process of building a BCI is very complicated and needs a good
      knowledge of neuroscience, computer science, and machine learning. The
      one working on building a BCI should know as much as possible about
      working on a Neuron which is the most important part of the human brain
      which will make the Brain chip ready and help in the I/O process. Neuron
      is a tiny cell that is generally regarded as the basic computational
      unit of the nervous system. It is responsible for sending or receiving
      information.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg ">There are a various types of brain responses one of which is
      <strong>Conditional response</strong>. Conditional responses are also
      seen in single neurons and networks. It requires some kind of condition
      for that operation to happen successfully. For example: <strong>Eberhard
        Fetz</strong> at the University of Washington utilized the idea of
        conditioning to demonstrate that the activity of a single neuron in a
      primate motor cortex can be conditioned to control the needle of an
      analog meter. The movement of the needle was directly coupled to the
      firing rate of the neurons, when the needle crossed a threshold, the
      monkey was rewarded. After several trials, the monkey learned to
      consistently move the needle past the threshold by increasing the firing
      rate of the recorded neuron. BCIs were able to read the electrical
      signals inside the neurons. EEG was widely used to measure electrical
      activity happening in the brain using small metal discs attached to the
      <strong>scalp</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg ">There are n number of organisations working on BCI. Example’s are
      kernel.com, Elon Musks neuralink, sensorium and etc.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-4xl px2 py-2" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="text-lg ">Brain Computer Interfacing indeed is a very good tech for the future
      of humans. It would allow controlling paralyzed people and they can just
      be better if their brain is active. Non-Invasive BCI is actually more
      affordable and easier to study and implement. But Invasive BCI is a
      quite complex technology on implmentation.</p>
      <p>Talking about Brain Chips, drawing out a conclusion from this is a
        bit hard, because Brain Chips are a hell lot of work and complexity.
        There are chances of death more than success. Making a brain chip,
        buying raw material, installing it, is too costly for common people.</p>
