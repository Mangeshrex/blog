Hi, I'm Mangesh. I am a student, tinkerer and a geek pursuing a Diploma curse. I am a person of diverse interests and opinions. I am a Free Software enthusiast and one of the first Free Software I used in my initial days was Linux and have been using it since then as a daily driver. 

This is my personal blog page, where I want to rant, present my opinions and write notes of whatever I want to.
