<h2 id="book-review---surely-youre-joking-mr.-feynman">Book Review -
Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman</h2>
<p>So, those of you who like reading, physics and crazy brains. You
might have come across a famous, physicist and he is called ~Dick
Feynman~ Richard Feynman. He was a physicist, a curious, a natural
problem solver. This blog is all about one of his biographical books
named “Surely You’re Joking Mr. Richard”.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-came-across-the-book">How I came across the book?</h2>
<p>I am a curious guy and I came across Richard Feynman through one of
my friends <a
href="https://github.com/uditkarode/.github/Readme.md">Github
Readme</a>. And then I googled up stuff for him and felt pretty
interesting about him. After a while, I came across this book. The book
cover covered pulled me like a magnet. So on, I started saving money to
get that book. And, then there came an opportunity walking towards me
and that opportunity was “Writing my Sister assignments”. I signed a
deal with her for 400rs (the book costed 350rs). And yeah, the deal was
signed and both the businessman returned back to offices with their
secretaries. It was no time to wait, I completed the assignments and
ordered the book.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-book-all-about">What is the book all about ?</h2>
<p>The book is all about Richard Feynman’s adventures in his life. It
starts from his first experiement of tinkering with Radio they had in
their house and announcing his friends Birthday on the radio. And,
continuing it all till the end. Ngl, due to college I took a lot of time
to complete this book, with a lot of inconsistencies. But it was surely
very fun. So, as said Richard Feynman was a very curious guy, he was
very active guy. He performed various science experiements in his
basement (like all cool kids do). Reading this book, gave me a discrete
sense of curiosity to me. Like feeling curious about very weird stuff
and also thinking constantly on a single topic. The book is full of
crazy stuff he did like playing safe’s, getting his one dollar back from
officers, Playing with Biological stuff, joining a music band in Brazil,
Staying in Japan, Getting into art, Portraying Nude womens, Trying to
trick people with speaking various languages, and teaching students
ofc.</p>
<h2 id="favourite-chapters">Favourite Chapters</h2>
<p>Speaking of some of my Favourite Chapters - Part 2: ‘Surely You’re
Joking Mr.Feynman’ - A Map of the Cat - Monster Minds - Part 3: ‘Fizzled
Fuses’ - Safecracker meets Safecracker - recommended - I want My One
Dollar - funniest - Lucky Numbers - Thirteen Times - But is it Art</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>The book is for curious folks, who have a certain hunger for
curiosity. It’s like “By the Curios, For the Curious, From the
Curious”.</p>
<p>One thing, I learn’t from the book is “not beign Narrow Minded”. From
the 2nd paragraph in this blog you might have had an idea, that Feynman
wasn’t only a physicists. He tinkered a lot with Math, Biology, Music,
Art and so on. He used to earn very well, it wasn’t like he was less on
money so he did all these things. But, it was all his curiosity and the
happiness he got from trying out various things. This is what I refer to
as not beign Narrow Minded.</p>
<p>Folks might brag about they being perfect in one single field, and
call someone with various hobbies as “Jack of all, Master of none”. But,
“You cannot Master anything to the fullest” is the contradictory quote
for them. Humans are one of the complex creatures, and should try
getting into different things. I’d say being Narrow Mindedness is the
worst mistake on would ever do. The world is full of mysteries, and fun
stuff. Which will arouse your curiosity.</p>
