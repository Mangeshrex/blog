    <h3>Hi, I'm Mangesh</h3>
    <p>I am an 18 (very soon) student and Free Software Enthusiast from India. I believe a lot in the hacker and tinkere culture and have been trying to be wonk about learning different things. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Currently, I'm based in bangalore because of my internship at <a href="https://fossunited.org/about">FOSS United</a> I am a third year diploma student, and I suck a lot at Academics. 
    <br />
    Me, my life and everything around me just happens randomly.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I was never a geek / technology guy from my childhood like most are. I was a hardcore and full time music player. I play tabla, used to play flute for a couple of years. I randomly got in tech due to instagram pages and basically "hacking". I might say I got interested into cybersecurity. Telegram helped me learn more and explore things differently.
