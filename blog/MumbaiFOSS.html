<h1 id="my-journey-to-mumbaifoss-and-my-experience-there">My journey to MumbaiFOSS and my experience there</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m doing my <strong>2nd-year diploma</strong> in <strong>computer engineering</strong>. I have always been a huge fan of <strong>FOSS</strong> such as GNU&#47;Linux, it was the reason I chose computer engineering but unfortunately, there was nothing in-depth on it in my course curriculum. I had seen people share posters of a FOSS event called IndiaFOSS on LinkedIn. I just looked up about it on the internet, it was conducted by FOSS United, a foundation that aims at promoting and strengthening the FOSS ecosystem in India. It was held in Bengaluru, far away from where I lived and my parents wouldn&#8217;t let me travel alone if I asked.</p>

<p>Despite the disheartening turn of events, I never gave up on my desire to attend a FOSS event. The next year, when a similar FOSS event called MumbaiFOSS was conducted by FOSS United in IIT Bombay. I decided that it was finally time for me to go. I asked my parents if they would allow me, and they agreed.</p>

<p>So, armed with some cash and fervor, I set off from Solapur to attend MumbaiFOSS on a local train for a journey of almost 500 km to reach the venue. I couldn&#8217;t sleep that night because of the excitement and the snoring of the sleeping passengers nearby. I reached Thane station in the early morning and got off the train. I took another local train from Thane to Kanjurmarg station. I reached Kanjurmarg station, I fell while getting off the train and I had a minor wound but I was more worried about whether my laptop was damaged. After checking laptop was safe, I took a rickshaw from there to Gate 2 of IIT Bombay. Being from a small city, I was excited to see an IIT campus for the first time, that too one of the best IITs in India. The campus was very beautiful, neat, and clean.</p>

<p>Once there, I ate a non-affordable breakfast outside the campus and then caught up with my telegram friend <strong>@MisanthropyDK</strong> (we met for the first time), and saw many peeps in the tech industry. I had a conversation with a white-haired man who was a <strong>Fedora fanboi</strong> and had years of experience in the FOSS industry, he was like an <strong>Indian version of Richard Stallman</strong>. From that conversation, it felt like age did not matter nor did the skillset each one of us carried with us, everything felt equal when we interacted. One thing I remember he said was, &#8220;All technologies are inter-related, some people are narrow minded they study only one technology and try to master it, that&#8217;s the reason why they cannot inter-relate with other technologies.&#8221;. I felt very motivated to keep up my hunger for learning many and not ust one.  </p>

<p>The first talk about the <strong>Prav app</strong>. The speakers gave a fantastic explanation of why <strong>XMPP</strong>, <strong>Matrix</strong>, and other open-source chat platforms are better to use. And they were able to convince the sense of privacy and control of these platforms. I was convinced that I should switch to Matrix.</p>

<p>The electronic field-related project which included eSIM made by <strong>Mr. Sumanto Kar</strong> and <strong>Mr. Nagesh Karmali</strong> was very cool. After a tea break, it was the talk on WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication). And this was the time when I came to know about servers like <strong>STUN</strong> and <strong>TURN</strong> that are used to create P2P connections when building a real-time application. And a lot more about the protocols used in WebRTC.</p>

<p>And then walks in <strong>Mr. Ashish Sahni</strong> who blew my mind. His topic was one of the hardest ones for me to digest, I mean it was a way too advanced topic than others. It was all about the data architecture and how powerful data fabrication. Honestly speaking, I don&#8217;t have much to tell about this. So I&#8217;ll back off from this.</p>

<p>The next talk was by <strong>Mr. Poruri Sai Rahul</strong>, an energetic and talented guy. His talk was about <strong>Digital Personal Data Protection Bills (DPDPB)</strong>. This was again a new topic for me. And this talk was the one I enjoyed the most. In short, the bill was about the protection of your data collected from whatever online platform you use. It may be a search engine or any other app. He started with a game called <strong>&#8220;Cost and Benefits&#8221;</strong>. What we had to do was just point out when the Cost and Benefits were high in a particular paragraph from the Data Bill. In my opinion, this was the only talk that was very interactive of all.</p>

<p>Then comes the fireside chat with Mr. Kailash Nadh. Those moments made me realize what life can be like beyond college lectures, it opened up a range of opportunities that didn’t seem possible before thanks to networking opportunities provided by events such as this one.</p>

<h1 id="rant-alert">Rant Alert</h1>

<p>The fireside chat with Kailash Nadh was an eye-opening experience that made me understand that we are just a bunch of scum in college who yet don&#8217;t know anything more advanced. It&#8217;s just 0.0000001℅ of the basics we engineering students know. We should be knowing and doing stuff that is far more advanced than the current scenario. I won&#8217;t blame anyone and I don&#8217;t even know whom should I blame. There are very less students in an engineering institute who care about tech and are fascinated by the processes. Everyone mostly runs behind being a topper, getting a good college ahead for being a grad. There are a lot of things that are unknown in this internet world that we yet need to explore and keep advancing with them.</p>

<p>This experience gave me a whole new perspective on life &#38; technology. If anyone thinks attending such events is expensive, it was only INR 1600&#47;- for train tickets, food, and registration.</p>
