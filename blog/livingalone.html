<h2 id="a-random-blog-where-im-blabbering">A random blog where I’m
blabbering</h2>
<p>I recently moved to Bangalore, it’s called the IT/Technical Hub of
India. Well, I moved here for my Internship at FOSS United. Thanks a lot
to my managers they invited me to come and work from office. And for me
this is kind of a very difference.</p>
<p>Before this I have never lived alone for more than 7 days, this is
the first ever time when I’ll be leaving alone, 650 km away from my
parents in a very new and busy city. I haven’t actually fell in love
with this city, well that’s obvious because I haven’t I haven’t explored
it much, I have only seen the negatives till now. I hope someone helps
me explore Bengaluru.</p>
<p>There have been moments, when I totally feel hatred and wanted to go
back, but on the contrary there are moments when I’m enjoying with my
colleagues, having fun learning different things. Whenever I take a
moment away from the computer, I am blank and I have very weird
questions in my mind.</p>
<p>But nvm Everything happens for good!</p>
