<p>This blog is me ranting about why I am way too confused as a
student.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-confusion-about">What is the confusion about ?</h3>
<p>I am a Computer Engineering student pursuing my diploma in a private
college in my city. Unlike the others, I am someone who questions every
small thing a lot and at times I’m very rude to people of my age group
near or around my college circle. I am barely accessible to everyone and
do not have a big circle. My margin is limited only to 3 other
students.</p>
<p>I feel like getting an education from an engineering college that has
no good staff or culture sucks so much that you might want to quit. I am
going through that similar situation. I often get confused about whether
should I study pass exams, get good marks or I should learn what is more
important and something that adds data into my cloud called my brain. I
believe more on the practical side of things so I of course chose the
second option of trying to learn what is more important to me. And, yes
there are disadvantages to it but tbh I feel very happy looking at a
couple of classmates of mine who are confused on the same yet chose to
walk on the first path of studying to pass the exam and gain good marks.
Why? because they want to study in a good college. No matter how they
fall behind in gaining real knowledge, they still want to cope with the
curriculum.</p>
<p>I honestly do not want to blame the students for choosing that path
because it’s what they are asked to walk on. Getting good marks, and
getting into a good college that has nice corporate candies with
packages of 8-10 or even 15-20 LPA is easier for them. I feel that is
legit but what about all the things you are missing out on now? What
about all the things you can learn. Perhaps, a student who chooses the
path of studying, marks, and good college won’t ever be able to learn
things that the commons do not. Even if they get a good job and want to
continue learning different things ahead in life, only 2% out of 100%
would be able to do just because coping with a Full Time Job is harder
than learning things when you’re a student and have ample amount of time
to learn and explore around whatever you like.</p>
<p>I always had this question in my mind, “Am I a dumbass retard who is
just not studying and will end up in a shit college paying double money
?”, or “Am I someone who on purpose does different things just to
flex?”. Honestly, yes I might end up in a bad college, but I will always
know something different from the majority. I believe in investing 90%
of my time working on different things and learning newer tech every
day. Just because that satisfies me and I love doing that.</p>
<p>One of my friends is going through the same. He seemed confused
between academics, self-learning, and helping his parents at home? I
never know what he must be facing, maybe even that easy for me to say
that focus on what’s important.</p>
<p>IMHO, I will never be able to manage academics and self-learning at
the same time. I would love to make the sacrifice of academics &lt;3 and
yes I’m still very dumb at basic things and haven’t mastered anything
special.</p>
<p>Not sure if I have solved my confusion or not, but questions are
important.</p>
