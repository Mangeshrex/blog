<article>
<p>This is a blog which will let y‚Äôall readers know how I am feeling
after climbing Maharashtra‚Äôs highest peak. Words probably won‚Äôt be of
much help but let‚Äôs give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="it-all-starts-with-a-post">It all starts with a post</h2>
<p>So, there‚Äôs a local community of trekkers in my city called
  <a href="ecofriendlyclub.in">EcofriendlyClub</a>. They‚Äôve been organizing treks to various places in the
Sahyadri Mountain Ranges from the last 7-8 years. I‚Äôve been them many
times to various places. So, I saw the announcement of Kalsubai Trek in
a whatsapp group. In the past I missed the opportunity for Kalsubai Trek
for 3 times consecutively. But everything happens for good right ?</p>
<h2 id="prep">Prep</h2>
<p>Kalsubai is 1646m (5400 ft) in height with total 15-16 km of walking
distance. So, for sure it needs pre-trek walking habbit. I love walking
hence, I just increased my walking time and distance. I started walking
10-15k steps everyday. Walking is the best thing to do after you do a
lot of sitting in frnot of computer.</p>
<p>The trek was for 2 days. The first day we explored worlds second
largest valley, <strong>Sandhan Valley</strong>. It‚Äôs has huge and tons
of stones inside. I felt like Bear Grylls when running and trekking
between them üòÇ. Need to give him the credits for showing how to climb
between two stones in his episodes.</p>
<h2 id="packing">Packing</h2>
<p>Talking of packing, I have done nothing, 2 hour before leaving I was
still sitting in front of the computer. I actually had to deploy my
internship project. So, I was totally messed up. But, my sister already
got all the things packed. So, it was just eating, changing and leaving
for the bus stop.</p>

- The 2nd Largest Valley in Asia</h2>
<p>As planned the first day of the trek is always a bonus for everyone.
The first day is full of enjoyment at various spots having good food,
and it‚Äôs like a chill moment for everyone stressed out. So, they had
planned Sandhan Valley for us first. We started the trek for Sandhan
Valley at something 1:45 something after having a traditional rural
village meal which is always tastier in its own and <strong>made with
utmost love</strong>. It was the first time in my life when I saw stones
big as thrice of my height. Chuckled up for sure. I was always conscious
of me not stepping up at the wrong place. I got stucked at a point where
it was too much clumsyness of people getting into the valley and others
getting out of the valley. So, after an hour of waiting I finally passed
that entry point. All of my mates already set ahead. I ran off all the
stones (P.S: I felt like bear grylls).</p>
<p>There are two spots in the valley where it is full of water. Very
soon, the first one showed up. I removed my shows and threw it to the
other side so that they don‚Äôt get wet. But Duhh! it didn‚Äôt happen as
expected. One of my bounced of by hittinga stone and felt into water. I
crossed it slowly and when I was going to pick it up, the most mandatory
things happened - I fell into water üòÇ (P.S: But that was refreshing,
water was cold). At the second patch we weren‚Äôt allowed to go ahead as I
was too late. So, I thought why not just sit and get a nice and natural
pedicure from small fishes.</p>

<p>Soon after that we returned out of the valley. We had yet another
good dinner. And set of to watch fireflies. Ngl, they were very
beautiful and made me feel sleepy. It‚Äôs a way too different mechanism of
insects. They literally have inbuilt Light Emitting Diodes inside them
üòÇ /jk.</p>
 
<p>Saw some kids playing their own kind of video game of real life. And I started running behind them :)</p>

<p>The night went well inside tent with just 2 of us in the whole
tent.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-moment">The Final Moment!!</h2>
<p>Morning and everyone ready to set off for the trek. I had a nice
power nap until we reached the base of the peak. Moreover because I felt
like vomitting ;-;. Soon as we reached, There was this huge as hell
mountain in front of us. I wasn‚Äôt much tensed because I had done 4 treks
before which were like tough enough. So, wasn‚Äôt a big issue for me.</p>
<p>The initial hour involved some difficult climbs, but the cool breeze
provided a sense of relief amid the pounding heartbeat. Moving at a good
pace, we enjoyed the trek, even discovering a small waterfall of water
droplets between the stones. I couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation and
positioned myself beneath it, experiencing a tremendous sense of
relief.</p>
<p>Found some black plum treks in the forest after sometime, So it was
mandatory to break and taste those sweet plums.</p>
<p>After an hour of trekking, the peak finally came into view. Its sheer
size ignited a strong desire to reach the top. Following the markings on
the stones, we made our way towards the peak, moving swiftly through the
last stretch.</p>

<p>And finally we reached the top. The moment everyone had a nice smile
on their faces. Removed my shoes, went to the temple. Prayed to the
goddess there saying ‚ÄúThank you for letting us reach the top!‚Äù.</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>I would like to extend my sincere thanks to <a href="ecofriendlyclub.in">EcoFriendly</a> for
organizing this awe-inspiring trek and for making my dream come
true.</p>
